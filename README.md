This is a TicTacToe Game I created for my CSCE 212 (Computer Architecture) class taught by William Hoskins in Fall 2022.

## Overview
Tic Tac Toe Game for Gameboy Advanced Console (CSCE 212)

## Features
- Developed a Tic Tac Toe game as the final project for a Computer Architecture class
- Utilized the C programming language and hardware constraints to create an aesthetically pleasing design
- Implemented a 256 RGB value color to GBA color converter as part of the project
- Applied advanced programming techniques from coursework to enhance the project and deliver a fun and engaging gaming experience
- Conducted extensive debugging and testing to ensure proper functionality and adherence to performance specifications
- Presented the completed game to the class, receiving positive feedback from both the instructor and classmates
- Leveraged knowledge of computer architecture and low-level programming to create a unique and challenging game that effectively utilized hardware constraints

## Installation
To run the TicTacToe game, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred C programming environment.
3. Compile and build the project.
4. Run the gba file using your preferred emulator.

## How to Play
- Upon starting the game, you will be presented with a 3x3 grid representing the Tic Tac Toe board.
- Two players take turns marking empty cells with their respective colors using the "O" symbol.
- The objective is to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three of your symbols.
- The first player to achieve this wins the game.
- If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
